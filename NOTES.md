# NOTICE
If you are gonna host this on a VPS/Server then remember to change the APIKey in 'Web.config',
Or you'll have a severe vulnerability on you're hands.

# NOTES
The description might be mis-leading, **I** (ErringPaladin10) made this repro because **I** wanted to build the [GridBot](https://github.com/mfdlabs/grid-bot) & The stuff from [RBXInfra](https://github.com/rbxinfra) easyly without changing **A LOT** of .Net Project files.
